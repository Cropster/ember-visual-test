# How does it work?

Whenever `capture` is called in the test, the node server will make a screenshot with
[simple-headless-chrome](https://github.com/LucianoGanga/simple-headless-chrome),
and save it in the `/visual-test-output/baseline` folder. Please commit this folder into source control!

Now, whenever the test is run, a new snapshot is made and put in the `/visual-test-output/tmp` folder
(do NOT put that into source control!). It then compares the two images with
[pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) and asserts accordingly.
If a mismatch is found, it will save an image with the diff of the two versions in the `/visual-test-output/diff` folder, to help you identify the issue.

Note that this means that if a screen changes consciously, you'll need to create
new baseline image for that screen. Here are some strategies you might want use:

- manually delete the image from the `/visual-test-output/baseline` folder
and run tests to generate new screenshot,
- manually move the image from the `/visual-test-output/tmp` folder to
the `/visual-test-output/baseline` folder,
- run `ember visual-test:reset` to delete and recreate _all images_,
- run `ember visual-test:approve` to make _all changed images_ a new baseline.
