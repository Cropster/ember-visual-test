# Example

For example, imagine you had an image like this the first time you ran the capture:

![Original Image](images/example-base-image.png)

Now, after some changes, you run the tests again, and this time, it captures this image:

![Changed Image](images/example-comparison-image.png)

This would result in an error, and generate the following diff image:

![Diff Image](images/example-diff-image.png)
